# MultiAgentApp

## PreRequisites

Navigtate to frontend folder and do

```bash
npm i
```

Specify the relevant API endpoint in the src/environments/enviroment.ts file apiUrl

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

> Use `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0` if you are using devcontainer.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
