## Activity 1: Connecting Agent Frameworks to Azure Cosmos DB

Here you will learn how to initialize Azure Cosmos DB and integrate with LangGraph to provide persistent memory for state management.

The problem with our agents so far is that state is only maintained in memory and is lost when the agent graph is restarted. To solve this problem, we will use Azure Cosmos DB to store the state of the agent. Azure Cosmos DB is a distributed NoSQL database service in Azure. It is designed to for applications requiring low latency and high availability. It is especially adept at handling massive volumes of data with high-concurrency. And its schema-agnostic design makes it ideally suited for theset types of applications. We will also use Azure Cosmos DB to store chat history.

Adding state management using Cosmos DB is easy with the checkpointer plugin.

### Checkpointer Plugin

The checkpointer plugin in LangGraph is a utility designed to facilitate the process of saving and restoring the state of an application at various points during its execution. This is particularly useful in multi-agent systems where maintaining consistent state across different agents and ensuring that progress can be resumed in case of failures or interruptions are critical.

Key Features of the Checkpointer Plugin:

- **State Management**: The checkpointer plugin allows developers to capture the current state of the agents and their interactions. This includes the data they are processing, their internal state, and any relevant context.
- **Persistence**: It provides mechanisms to persist this state to a durable storage medium, such as a database or file system. This ensures that the state can be reloaded even after a system crash or restart.
- **Restoration**: The plugin supports restoring the state to a previous checkpoint. This allows the system to resume operations from a known good state, reducing the need for reprocessing and minimizing downtime.
- **Consistency**: It ensures consistency across different agents by coordinating the checkpointing process. This is crucial in distributed systems where agents might be operating on different nodes or environments.
- **Configuration**: Developers can configure the frequency and conditions under which checkpoints are created. This flexibility allows for balancing between performance overhead and reliability.

### Storing Agent State

Let's add the Checkpointer Plugin to our application.

1. To begin, open the **banking_agents.py** file.
1. Copy the code below to the top of the file with the other imports:

```python
from langgraph_checkpoint_cosmosdb import CosmosDBSaver
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import DATABASE_NAME, checkpoint_container, chat_container, update_chat_container, \
    patch_active_agent
```

1. In the same **banking_agents.py** file, scroll down to locate the following lines:

```python
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

1. Replace those two lines with the code below:

```python
checkpointer = CosmosDBSaver(database_name=DATABASE_NAME, container_name=checkpoint_container)
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

From this point on, the agent will save its state to Azure Cosmos DB. The *CosmosDBSaver* class will save the state of the agent to the database represented by the global variable, `DATABASE_NAME` in the *checkpoint_container* container.

### Enhance the agent routing

When you wired up the API layer in Module 1, Cosmos DB began storing a history of chat messages. These messages are stored for convenience, while state is being stored in the checkpoint container in Cosmos DB using the code you added above.

In this application, we're taking an opinionated approach to agent routing. Instead of relying on the coordinator to use the LLM to route messages in a non-deterministic manner to the appropriate agent based on the context, we're going to store the "active agent" in the chat container in Cosmos DB (a single record maintained for each session). We're choosing to do this so that the coordinator can always deterministically route back to the active agent (if known) in a multi-turn conversation.

1. Remain in the **banking_agents.py** file.
1. Locate the following code.

```python
def call_coordinator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["coordinator_agent", "human"]]:
    response = coordinator_agent.invoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

1. Replace it with the following code.

```python
def call_coordinator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["coordinator_agent", "human"]]:
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    userId = config["configurable"].get("userId", "UNKNOWN_USER_ID")
    tenantId = config["configurable"].get("tenantId", "UNKNOWN_TENANT_ID")

    logging.debug(f"Calling coordinator agent with Thread ID: {thread_id}")

    # Get the active agent from Cosmos DB with a point lookup
    partition_key = [tenantId, userId, thread_id]
    activeAgent = None
    try:
        activeAgent = chat_container.read_item(
            item=thread_id, 
            partition_key=partition_key).get('activeAgent', 'unknown')

    except Exception as e:
        logging.debug(f"No active agent found: {e}")

    if activeAgent is None:
        if local_interactive_mode:
            update_chat_container({
                "id": thread_id,
                "tenantId": "Contoso",
                "userId": "Mark",
                "sessionId": thread_id,
                "name": "cli-test",
                "age": "cli-test",
                "address": "cli-test",
                "activeAgent": "unknown",
                "ChatName": "cli-test",
                "messages": []
            })

    logging.debug(f"Active agent from point lookup: {activeAgent}")

    # If active agent is something other than unknown or coordinator_agent, transfer directly to that agent
    if activeAgent is not None and activeAgent not in ["unknown", "coordinator_agent"]:
        logging.debug(f"Routing straight to last active agent: {activeAgent}")
        return Command(update=state, goto=activeAgent)
    else:
        response = coordinator_agent.invoke(state)
        return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

Finally, we add changes for interactive mode to the customer service agent as well (these changes are only need for testing the backend directly - if you have wired up the front end they are redundant, but we add them for posterity here).

1. Locate the following code in the **banking_agents.py** file.

```python
def call_customer_support_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["customer_support_agent", "human"]]:
    response = customer_support_agent.invoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

1. Replace it with the following code.

```python
def call_customer_support_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["customer_support_agent", "human"]]:
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    if local_interactive_mode:
        patch_active_agent(
            tenantId="Contoso", 
            userId="Mark", 
            sessionId=thread_id,
            activeAgent="customer_support_agent")

    response = customer_support_agent.invoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

The *patch_active_agent* function is used to store which agent is currently active within the application.

### Let's review

In this activity, we completed the following key steps:

- **Stored the active agent in Cosmos DB**:  
  We added logic to persist the current "active agent" in Azure Cosmos DB. Before routing, we check if an agent is already active—if so, the system routes the conversation directly to that agent without relying on further reasoning.

- **Enabled persistent state**:  
  We configured the application to store conversation state in Cosmos DB, ensuring the data persists beyond the current runtime session and can be retrieved across sessions or restarts.

- **Patched the active agent after agent transfer**:  
  After handing off to a new agent, we update the `activeAgent` field in the Cosmos DB `Chat` container. This ensures deterministic, turn-by-turn routing—especially when it's known which agent asked the last question.

> **Note**: While it's technically possible to rely on the LLM to determine the next agent using reasoning alone, this approach is generally less reliable and may not be suitable for scenarios requiring consistency and control.

## Activity 2: Test your Work

With the activities in this module complete, it is time to test your work! Let's test our agents!

### Start a Conversation

1. In you browser, return to the frontend and hit refresh.
1. Type the following text:

```text
I want some help
```

You should see your query being routed to the customer support agent and a response generated:

![Testing_1](./media/module-02/testing1.png)

Let's prove that agent state is preserved.

1. Stay in your browser, and return to the Azure Portal.
1. Open the Cosmos DB account deployed with this lab.
1. Navigate to Data Explorer within the Cosmos DB blade.
1. Locate and open the Chat container.
1. You should see the chat history stored there.

You may also want to look at the checkpoints container in your Cosmos DB account. You should see the agent state stored there. The data is generated by LangGraph. There is much more data stored in this container as it is not only maintaining the chat history, but also the state of the agent, and any other agent, including computations in between transfers. This allows for a richer conversational experience as the full agent state is remembered and checkpointed regularly.

## Validation Checklist

Your implementation is successful if:

- [ ] Your app compiles with no warnings or errors.
- [ ] Your agent successfully connects to Azure Cosmos DB.
