# Module 03 - Agent Specialization

**[< Connecting Agents to Memory](./Module-02.md)** - **[Multi-Agent Orchestration >](./Module-04.md)**

## Introduction

In this Module you'll learn how to implement agent specialization by creating Semantic Kernel Functions or LangGraph Tools that provide the functionality necessary to power individual agents that comprise a multi-agent system.

## Learning Objectives and Activities

- Learn the basics for LangGraph Tools
- Learn how to implement semantic and natural language features using vector indexing and search integration from Azure Cosmos DB.
- Learn how to define tasks and communication protocols for seamless collaboration.

## Module Exercises

1. [Activity 1: Creating Multiple Agents](#activity-1-creating-multiple-agents)
1. [Activity 2: Adding Agent Tools](#activity-2-adding-agent-tools)
1. [Activity 3: Semantic Search](#activity-3-semantic-search)
1. [Activity 4: Test your Work](#activity-4-test-your-work)

## Activity 1: Creating Multiple Agents

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create multiple agents that specialize in different tasks. You will learn how to define the roles and responsibilities of each agent and how to define the communication protocols between them.

In the earlier modules, you created a single customer service agent that specialized in a single set of tasks, and a coordinator agent that was responsible for transferring responsibility to that agent. In this module, you will broaden the scope of that agent, and create more agents that handle different tasks. You will define the roles and responsibilities of each agent and define the communication protocols between them.

First, let's add a new transactions agent and sales agent.

### Define the New Agents

1. To begin, open the **banking_agents.py** file.
1. Locate the lines that define the **customer_support_agent_tools** and the **customer_support_agent**
1. Paste the following code below.

```python
transactions_agent_tools = []
transactions_agent = create_react_agent(
    model,
    transactions_agent_tools,
    state_modifier=load_prompt("transactions_agent"),
)

sales_agent_tools = []
sales_agent = create_react_agent(
    model,
    sales_agent_tools,
    state_modifier=load_prompt("sales_agent"),
)
```

### Update the Coordinator Agent

Lets also update the coordinator agent tool definition so that it can transfer to both the customer support agent and the transactions agent.

1. Locate the **coordinator_agent_tools** definition.

```python
coordinator_agent_tools = [
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="customer_support_agent"),
]   
```

1. Replace this code with the following.

```python
coordinator_agent_tools = [
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="customer_support_agent"),
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="transactions_agent"),
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="sales_agent"),
]
```

### Define the New Functions

We also need to add calling functions for the two new agents.

1. Locate the function, **def call_customer_support_agent**.
1. Below this function, paste two new functions.

```python
def call_sales_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["sales_agent", "human"]]:
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    if local_interactive_mode:
        patch_active_agent(
            tenantId="Contoso", 
            userId="Mark", 
            sessionId=thread_id,
            activeAgent="sales_agent")
    response = sales_agent.invoke(state, config)  # Invoke sales agent with state
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")


def call_transactions_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["transactions_agent", "human"]]:
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    if local_interactive_mode:
        patch_active_agent(
            tenantId="Contoso", 
            userId="Mark", 
            sessionId=thread_id,
            activeAgent="transactions_agent")
    response = transactions_agent.invoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")
```

### Update Workflow

Finally, we need to add these agents as nodes in the graph with their calling functions.

1. Locate the **StateGraph** builder further below in the file.
1. Add these two lines to the `StateGraph` builder.

```python
builder.add_node("transactions_agent", call_transactions_agent)
builder.add_node("sales_agent", call_sales_agent)
```

We've now added two new agents, and adjusted the coordinator agent so it can transfer to all three agents.

## Activity 2: Adding Agent Tools

In this activity, you will learn how to add tools to your agents. You will also learn how to define the API contracts for these plugins and how to test and debug them.

### What are tools?

By "tools" we mean functions or discreet actions that each agent can perform. A tool will typically have input parameters (though it can also have none) and the agent will be responsible for extracting the input values from the conversational context and calling the tool when appropriate.

We already added a type of tool to the coordinator agent in the previous module, but that tool only allowed agents to hand off to each-other. In this module, we will add more functional tools to each agent that will allow them to perform other actions, including transactions against the database.

### Defining New Tools

We are going to define a series of tools that allow the customer agents to perform specific actions for users including creating new accounts, balance inquiries, and varios other banking transactions.

1. In VS Code, open the file **src/app/tools/sales.py**.
1. In the empty file, add the following code.

```python
from typing import Any

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_core.tools import tool

    fetch_latest_account_number

@tool

    """

    This function retrieves the latest account number, increments it, and creates a new account record
    in Cosmos DB associated with a specific user and tenant.
    """
    print(f"Creating account for {account_holder}")
    thread_id = config["configurable"].get("thread_id", "UNKNOWN_THREAD_ID")
    userId = config["configurable"].get("userId", "UNKNOWN_USER_ID")
    tenantId = config["configurable"].get("tenantId", "UNKNOWN_TENANT_ID")
    max_attempts = 10
    account_number = fetch_latest_account_number()

    print(f"Latest account number: {account_number}")
    if account_number is None:
        account_number = 1
    else:
        account_number += 1

    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        account_data = {
            "id": f"{account_number}",

                "key2": "Value2"
            }
        }
        try:
            print(f"Creating account record: {account_data}")
            create_account_record(account_data)
            return f"Successfully created account {account_number} for {account_holder} with a balance of ${balance}"
        except Exception as e:
            account_number += 1
            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                return f"Failed to create account after {max_attempts} attempts: {e}"

    return f"Failed to create account after {max_attempts} attempts"

@tool
def calculate_monthly_payment(loan_amount: float, years: int) -> float:
    """Calculate the monthly payment for a loan."""
    interest_rate = 0.05  # Hardcoded annual interest rate (5%)
    monthly_rate = interest_rate / 12  # Convert annual rate to monthly
    total_payments = years * 12  # Total number of monthly payments

    if monthly_rate == 0:
        return loan_amount / total_payments  # If interest rate is 0, simple division

    monthly_payment = (loan_amount * monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate) ** total_payments) / \
                      ((1 + monthly_rate) ** total_payments - 1)

    return round(monthly_payment, 2)  # Rounded to 2 decimal places
```

### Integrate the New Tools

With the tools defined, we need to update the tool definitions for each agent.

1. In VS Code, open the **banking_agents.py** file.
1. At the top of the file, add the following import statements:

```python
from src.app.tools.sales import calculate_monthly_payment, create_account
from src.app.tools.support import get_branch_location, service_request
from src.app.tools.transactions import bank_balance, bank_transfer, get_transaction_history
```

1. Next, locate the line containing the empty *customer_support_agent_tools = []*
1. Update it with the code below.

```python
customer_support_agent_tools = [
    get_branch_location,
    service_request,
]
```

1. Next, scroll a further down in this file to locate, the empty *transactions_agent_tools = []*.
1. Update it with the code below.

```python
transactions_agent_tools = [
    bank_balance,
    bank_transfer,
    get_transaction_history,
]
```

1. Finally, scroll further down to the empty *sales_agent_tools = []*.
1. Update it with the code below.

```python
sales_agent_tools = [
    calculate_monthly_payment,
    create_account, 
]
```

We're done defining the tools each agent has access to, but we still need to define *when* these tools should be called. To do this, we need to update the agent prompts.

### Updating Agent Prompts

Since the agents have now been built, we can update the coordinator agent's prompt to route to them.

1. In VS Code, open the file **src/app/prompts/coordinator_agent.prompty**.
1. Replace the contents with this text below.

```text
You are a Chat Initiator and Request Router in a bank.
Your primary responsibilities include welcoming users, and routing requests to the appropriate agent.
If the user needs general help, transfer to 'customer_support' for help.
If the user wants to open a new account or take our a bank loan or ask about banking offers, transfer to 'sales_agent'.
If the user wants to check their account balance or make a bank transfer, transfer to 'transactions_agent'.
You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent.
```

Now that the customer support agent has a service request tool, we can update the prompt for the customer support agent.

1. Next, open the file **src/app/prompts/customer_support_agent.prompty**.
1. Replace the contents with this text below.

```text
You are a customer support agent that can give general advice on banking products and branch locations
If the user wants to make a complaint or speak to someone, ask for the user's phone number and email address,
and say you will get someone to call them back, call 'service_request' tool with these values and pass config along with a summary of what they said into the requestSummary parameter.
You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent.
```

Note that we are not explicitly naming the branch location tool, as this is already implied in the first part of the prompt. However, keep a note of this when you test the agent. Does it always call the tool when you expect? Or does the prompt need to be more specific?

Next, update the prompt for the transactions agent.

1. Open the empty file **src/app/prompts/transactions_agent.prompty**.
1. Paste this text below.

```text
You are a banking transactions agent that can handle account balance enquiries and bank transfers.
If the user wants to make a deposit or withdrawal or transfer, ask for the amount and the account number which they want to transfer from and to.
Then call 'bank_transfer' tool with toAccount, fromAccount, and amount values.
Make sure you confirm the transaction details with the user before calling the 'bank_transfer' tool then call 'bank_transfer' tool with these values.
If the user wants to know transaction history, ask for the start and end date, and call 'get_transaction_history' tool with these values.
If the user needs general help, transfer to 'customer_support' for help.
You MUST respond with the repayment amounts before transferring to another agent.
```

Finally, lets update the prompt for the sales agent.

1. Open the empty file **src/app/prompts/sales_agent.prompty**
1. Paste this text below.

```text
You are a sales agent that can help users with creating a new account, or taking out bank loans.
If the user wants to check their account balance, make a bank transfer, or get transaction history, transfer to 'transactions_agent'.
If the user wants to create a new account, you must ask for the account holder's name and the initial balance.
Call create_account tool with these values, and also pass the config. Be sure to tell the user their full new account number including A prefix.
If customer wants to open anything other than a banking account, advise that you can only open a banking account and if they want any other sort of account they will need to contact the branch.
If user wants to take out a loan, you can offer a loan quote. You must ask for the loan amount and the number of years for the loan.
When user provides these, calculate the monthly payment using calculate_monthly_payment tool and provide the result as part of the response.
Do not return the monthly payment tool call output directly to the user, include it with the rest of your response.
If the user wants to move ahead with the loan, advise that they need to come into the branch to complete the application.
If the wants information about a product or offer, ask whether they want Credit Card or Savings, then call 'get_offer_information' tool with the user_prompt, and the accountType ('CreditCard' or 'Savings').
You MUST respond with the repayment amounts before transferring to another agent.
```

## Activity 3: Semantic Search

We are going to add one more tool that is a little different from the others. This tool will allow the customer support agent to perform a semantic search for products in the bank's database. We'll use Azure Cosmos DB Vector Search capability to perform a semantic search against the OffersData container.

1. In VS Code, open the file **src/app/tools/sales.py**
1. Add these imports to the top of the file.

```python
from src.app.services.azure_cosmos_db import vector_search
from src.app.services.azure_open_ai import generate_embedding
```

1. Next, paste the code for this tool below the imports at the top.

```python
@tool
def get_offer_information(user_prompt: str, accountType: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Provide information about a product based on the user prompt.
    Takes as input the user prompt as a string."""
    # Perform a vector search on the Cosmos DB container and return results to the agent
    vectors = generate_embedding(user_prompt)
    search_results = vector_search(vectors, accountType)
    return search_results
```

You can implement this tool in exactly the same way as the other tools.

1. In VS Code, open the **banking_agents.py**
1. Locate this import at the top of the file.

```python
from src.app.tools.sales import calculate_monthly_payment, create_account
```

1. Replace it with this updated import statement.

```python
from src.app.tools.sales import calculate_monthly_payment, create_account, get_offer_information
```

1. Next, locate this code.

```python
sales_agent_tools = [
    calculate_monthly_payment,
    create_account,
]
```

1. And replace it with this.

```python
sales_agent_tools = [
    get_offer_information,
    calculate_monthly_payment,
    create_account,
]
```

## Activity 4: Test your Work

With the activities in this module complete, it is time to test your work!

### Ready to test

Let's test our agents!

1. In you browser, return to the frontend and hit refresh.
1. Start a new conversation.
1. Type the following text to try transferring money between accounts.

```text
I want to transfer 500 from account Acc001 to Acc003
```

![Testing_1](./media/module-03/testing_module3_1.png)

1. Wait until the transaction has been completed by the agent.
1. Return to the Azure Portal, open the Cosmos DB account
1. Open the AccountsData container.
1. Verify the transaction was successful.

Let's test a new scenario that will invoke a vector search in Cosmos DB on our banking offers.

1. Return to the frontend in your browser.
1. Create a new conversation.
1. Type the following text to try asking about banking offers:

 ```text
 Tell me about banking offers
 ```

1. You should see results like this below (you might have to specify which type of offer, e.g. "Savings"):

![Testing_2](./media/module-03/testing_module3_2.png)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Account Balance agent functions correctly
- [ ] Semantic Search for Product Agent functions correctly
- [ ] Service Request agent successfully creates a new service request on behalf of user
- [ ] New Service request is correctly read by second service request agent
