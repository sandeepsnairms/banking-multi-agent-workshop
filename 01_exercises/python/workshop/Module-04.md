# Module 04 - Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Introduction

In this Module you'll learn how to implement the multi-agent orchestration to tie all of the agents you have created so far together into a single system. You'll also learn how to test the system as a whole is working correctly and how to debug and monitor the agents performance and behavior and troubleshoot them.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to write prompts for agents
- Define agent routing
- Learn how to define API contracts for a multi-agent system
- Learn how to test and debug agents, monitoring

## Module Exercises

1. [Activity 1: Agent to Agent Communication](#activity-1-agent-to-agent-communication)
1. [Activity 2: Test your work](#activity-2-test-your-work)
1. [Activity 3: Implement Agent Tracing and Monitoring](#activity-3-implement-agent-tracing-and-monitoring)
1. [Bonus Activity: Test with Swagger](#bonus-activity-test-with-swagger)

## Activity 1: Agent to Agent Communication

In this exercise, you will enhance the multi-agent banking application by enabling agent-to-agent communication through routing logic. So far, you’ve built several specialized agents—such as customer support, sales, and transactions—that can perform specific tasks. However, these agents operate in isolation and rely entirely on the coordinator agent to route and handle all interactions.

This setup limits the system’s flexibility: if an agent encounters a query it cannot handle, it has no way of collaborating with other agents directly. That’s where agent routing comes in.

With this enhancement, agents will be able to talk to each other—consulting, sharing context, and collaborating on tasks. For example, a sales agent might ask the transactions agent for account information before making a recommendation, or a support agent might escalate a case to sales directly.

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Implement inter-agent routing and communication.
- Improve the system’s ability to handle complex or multi-step requests.
- Enable more autonomous and intelligent agent behavior.

This upgrade not only reduces dependency on the coordinator but also creates a more collaborative and efficient agent ecosystem, reflecting real-world teamwork dynamics.

1. In VS Code, open the **banking_agents.py** file.
1. Locate the **customer_support_agent_tools**.
1. Update it with the below code.

```python
customer_support_agent_tools = [
    get_branch_location,
    service_request,
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="sales_agent"),
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="transactions_agent"),
]
```

1. Next, locate the **transactions_agent_tools**.
1. Update it with the below code.

```python
transactions_agent_tools = [
    bank_balance,
    bank_transfer,
    get_transaction_history,
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="customer_support_agent"),
]
```

1. Next, locate **sales_agent**, and update it with the below code:

```python
sales_agent_tools = [
    get_offer_information,
    calculate_monthly_payment,
    create_account,
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="customer_support_agent"),
    create_agent_transfer(agent_name="transactions_agent"),
]
```

We need to update the prompts of agents accordingly as we have updated the tools each agent can call.

1. In VS Code, open the file **src/app/prompts/coordinator_agent.prompty**
1. Update with the following text.

```text
You are a Chat Initiator and Request Router in a bank.  
Your primary responsibilities include welcoming users, and routing requests to the appropriate agent.  
If the user needs general help, transfer to 'customer_support' for help.  
If the user wants to open a new account or take our a bank loan or ask about banking offers, transfer to 'sales_agent'.  
You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent.
```

1. Next, open the file **src/app/prompts/customer_support_agent.prompty**
1. Update with the following text.

```text
You are a customer support agent that can give general advice on banking products and branch locations  
If the user wants to open a new account or take our a bank loan or ask about banking offers, transfer to 'sales_agent'.  
If the user wants to check their account balance, make a bank transfer, or get transaction history, transfer to 'transactions_agent'.  
If the user wants to make a complaint or speak to someone, ask for the user's phone number and email address,  
and say you will get someone to call them back, call 'service_request' tool with these values and pass config along with a summary of what they said into the requestSummary parameter.  
You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent.
```

1. Next, open the empty file **src/app/prompts/transactions_agent.prompty**
1. Update with the following text.

```text
You are a banking transactions agent that can handle account balance enquiries and bank transfers.  
If the user wants to make a deposit or withdrawal or transfer, ask for the amount and the account number which they want to transfer from and to.  
Then call 'bank_transfer' tool with toAccount, fromAccount, and amount values.  
Make sure you confirm the transaction details with the user before calling the 'bank_transfer' tool.  
then call 'bank_transfer' tool with these values.  
If the user wants to know transaction history, ask for the start and end date, and call 'get_transaction_history' tool with these values.  
If the user needs general help, transfer to 'customer_support' for help.  
You MUST respond with the repayment amounts before transferring to another agent.
```

1. Finally, navigate to the empty file **src/app/prompts/sales_agent.prompty**
1. Update with the following text:

```text
You are a sales agent that can help users with creating a new account, or taking out bank loans or providing information about new banking offers.  
If the user wants information about a product or banking offers, ask whether they want Credit Card or Savings, then call 'get_offer_information' tool with the user_prompt, and the accountType ('CreditCard' or 'Savings').  
If the user wants to check their account balance, make a bank transfer, or get transaction history, transfer to 'transactions_agent'.  
If the user wants to create a new account, you must ask for the account holder's name and the initial balance.  
Call create_account tool with these values, and also pass the config. Be sure to tell the user their full new account number including A prefix.  
If customer wants to open anything other than a banking account, advise that you can only open a banking account and if they want any other sort of account they will need to contact the branch.  
If user wants to take out a loan, you can offer a loan quote. You must ask for the loan amount and the number of years for the loan.  
When user provides these, calculate the monthly payment using calculate_monthly_payment tool and provide the result as part of the response.  
Do not return the monthly payment tool call output directly to the user, include it with the rest of your response.  
If the user wants to move ahead with the loan, advise that they need to come into the branch to complete the application.  
You MUST respond with the repayment amounts before transferring to another agent.
```

## Activity 2: Test your work

With these updates, each agent is now equipped with the ability to delegate tasks and transfer control to other relevant agents when needed.

### Start a Conversation

1. In you browser, return to our frontend, <http://localhost:4200/> and hit refresh.
1. Create a new conversation and try transferring money again as shown below.
1. Type the following text:

```text
I want to transfer money
```

1. When prompted provide the amount and the accounts to tranfer from and to.

```text
I want to transfer 500 from Acc001 to Acc003
```

1. When prompted, confirm the transaction.
1. The conversion should look similar to this.

![Testing_1](./media/module-04/testing_module_4-1.png)

Now, let's again try asking about banking offers to invoke vector search, as shown below.

1. In the same conversation, type the following text:

```text
Tell me something about your banking offers
```

1. Because the transactions agent can only transfer to the customer service agent, it will transfer you there first, so you may have to ask the same question again to get transferred to the sales agent. When finally transferred to the sales agent (which handles queries about product information) it will respond with a range of offers to choose from.
1. Type the following text:

```text
credit card
```

1. As the agents can talk to each other, the `transactions_agent` after completing the account transfer, calls the *customer_support_agent*, which in turn calls the *sales_agent* to finally get us a result using Cosmos DB Vector Search.
1. The conversation should look similar to this.

![Testing_2](./media/module-04/testing_module_4-2.png)

## Activity 3: Implement Agent Tracing and Monitoring

In this activity, you'll integrate LangSmith, a powerful observability and monitoring platform, into our multi-agent application. You'll learn how to trace agent interactions and monitor application behavior using LangSmith's build in tools. This would help you understand how your agents perform, where bottlenecks occur, and how the application behaves end-to-end.

### Creating a LangSmith Account

1. Visit <https://smith.langchain.com>
2. Click Sign Up and create your free LangSmith account.
3. Once you're signed in, go to your Account Settings, and create a new API Key.

**Note:** you should record the user credentials and optionally the keys for this if you'd like to keep this beyond this lab.

### Adding LangSmith Environment Variables

1. Open the **.env** file in the python folder of the code base.

```python
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="<your_langsmith_api_key>"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="multi-agent-banking-app"
```

1. Your .env file should look like this after adding the above lines.

```python
COSMOSDB_ENDPOINT="<your_cosmos_db_uri>"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="<your_azure_open_ai_uri>"
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGDEPLOYMENTID="text-embedding-3-small"
AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETIONSDEPLOYMENTID="gpt-4o"
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_applications_insights_conn_string>"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="<your_langsmith_api_key>"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="multi-agent-banking-app"
```

### Adding tracing to the Agents

LangSmith makes it easy to trace specific functions or agents using the @traceable decorator.

The decorator works by creating a run tree for you each time the function is called and inserting it within the current trace. The function inputs, name, and other information is then streamed to LangSmith. If the function raises an error or if it returns a response, that information is also added to the tree, and updates are patched to LangSmith so you can detect and diagnose sources of errors. This is all done on a background thread to avoid blocking your app's execution.

LangSmith UX is built in a way that different components of your multi-agent application get rendered differently. LangSmith supports many different types of Runs - you can specify the type of Run in the @traceable decorator. The types of runs are:

1. LLM: Invokes an LLM
1. Retriever: Retrieves documents from databases or other sources
1. Tool: Executes actions with function calls
1. Chain: Default type; combines multiple Runs into a larger process
1. Prompt: Hydrates a prompt to be used with an LLM
1. Parser: Extracts structured data

Let's update our code to add @traceable decorator so that we can monitor the traces in langsmith.

1. In VS Code, navigate to the file **banking_agents.py** file.
1. At the top of this file, add the import shown below.

```python
from langsmith import traceable
```

1. Locate the function call, **def call_coordinator_agent(state: MessagesState, config)**
1. Add `@traceable(run_type="llm")` on top of the function.
1. It should look like this now.

```python
@traceable(run_type="llm")
def call_coordinator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["coordinator_agent", "human"]]:
```

1. Next, do this for other functions in the **banking_agents.py** file. 
1. Your functions should all look like this.

```python
@traceable(run_type="llm")
def call_coordinator_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["coordinator_agent", "human"]]:

@traceable(run_type="llm")
def call_customer_support_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["customer_support_agent", "human"]]:

@traceable(run_type="llm")
def call_sales_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["sales_agent", "human"]]:

@traceable(run_type="llm")
def call_transactions_agent(state: MessagesState, config) -> Command[Literal["transactions_agent", "human"]]:

@traceable
def human_node(state: MessagesState, config) -> None:

@traceable(run_type="llm")
def interactive_chat():
```

1. Next, open the **tools/support.py** file.
1. Add the import below to the imports at the top of this file.

```python
from langsmith import traceable
```

1. Next, add `@traceable` on top of all the functions in this file. 

**Note:** We are not adding the run type on these functions because we already have `@tool` decorator on top of these functions which would help LangSmith to infer that these are tools used by the Agents. It should look like this.

```python
@tool
@traceable
def service_request(config: RunnableConfig,  recipientPhone: str, recipientEmail: str,
                    requestSummary: str) -> str:

@tool
@traceable
def get_branch_location(state: str) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
```

1. Open the **tools/sales.py** file.
1. Add the below import line under the imports for this file.

```python
from langsmith import traceable
```

1. Add the `@traceable` decorator to every function in this file.
1. It should look like this now.

```python
@tool
@traceable(run_type="retriever")
def get_offer_information(user_prompt: str, accountType: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:

@tool
@traceable
def create_account(account_holder: str, balance: float, config: RunnableConfig) -> str:

@tool
@traceable
def calculate_monthly_payment(loan_amount: float, years: int) -> float:
```

1. Fionally, open the **tools/transactions.py** file.
1. Add the below import line under the imports for this file.

```python
from langsmith import traceable
```

1. Add the *@traceable* decorator to every function.
1. It should look like this now.

```python
@tool
@traceable
def bank_transfer(config: RunnableConfig, toAccount: str, fromAccount: str, amount: float) -> str:

@tool
@traceable
def get_transaction_history(accountId: str, startDate: datetime, endDate: datetime) -> List[Dict]:

@tool
@traceable
def bank_balance(config: RunnableConfig, account_number: str) -> str:
```

### Let's monitor traces in LangSmith

1. In VS Code, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
python -m src.app.banking_agents
```

1. Next, open a new tab in your browser and navigate to, <https://smith.langchain.com/> to make sure our project is listed under traces. 
1. The project name will be `multi-agent-banking-app` as we mentioned in our .env file.

**Note:** If you are not able to see your project under traces, search for banking in the search bar, and then you should be able to see it.

![LangSmith_1](./media/module-04/lang_smith_1.png)

Try asking about banking offers to invoke a vector search again:

```shell
Welcome to the single-agent banking assistant.
Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

You: Tell me about banking offers
transfer_to_sales_agent...
sales_agent: Would you like information about Credit Card offers or Savings offers? Let me know so I can provide the most relevant details for you!
```

You can see in the below image that the app starts with the coordinator agent, which calls the sales agent based on the user prompt. Clicking on the agent, under sales_agent as highlighted in the below image, you can check the stack trace of the conversation between Human and AI.

![LangSmith_2](./media/module-04/lang_smith_2.png)

Try asking about credit card offers.

```shell
Welcome to the single-agent banking assistant.
Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

You: Tell me about banking offers
transfer_to_sales_agent...
sales_agent: Would you like information about Credit Card offers or Savings offers? Let me know so I can provide the most relevant details for you!

You: Credit Card
```

You can again see conversation between Human and AI based on the new user prompt, that we asked about credit card offers. 

![LangSmith_3](./media/module-04/lang_smith_3.png)

You can see in the below image the stacktrace of the retriever tool call made to the cosmos db to perform vector search. Click the `get_offer_information` as highlighted in the image below. Scroll to the bottom, and you would be able to see the vector search results returned by the query made to cosmos db. 

![LangSmith_4](./media/module-04/lang_smith_4.png)

You can see the result produced by the LLM after getting the result back from the vector search query. Click on the agent as highlighted in the image below, to view the LLM result. You should be able to see the same result printed on the terminal of your IDE.

![LangSmith_5](./media/module-04/lang_smith_5.png)

You can try with the below example as well to monitor trace of the transactions agent. Please type `exit` to end the conversation and start a new one, before trying this example.

```shell
Welcome to the single-agent banking assistant.
Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

You: Show me transactions for account Acc001
transfer_to_transactions_agent...
transactions_agent: Please provide the start and end dates for the transaction history you would like to view for account Acc001.

You: start date as 2025-02-07 and end date as 2025-02-12
```

The run which has a loading icon in front of it should be the current trace.

![LangSmith_6](./media/module-04/lang_smith_6.png)

You can click the final agent call, highlighted below to see the final result created by the LLM based on the results returned by the cosmos db query. You would be able to see the same result in your terminal running on your IDE.

![LangSmith_8](./media/module-04/lang_smith_8.png)

## Bonus Activity: Test with Swagger

We've been testing using the frontend for this lab, but as you can clearly see, this solution is built as a backend that exposes API's called by the frontend. This makes it easy for us to do automated unit testing without requiring a human. With the API layer ready, let's explore simple testing against our API layer in our application.

Start the FastAPI server:

1. If the backend is closed, restart the backend:

```shell
uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 63280
```

Next, open a new browser tab and navigate to <http://localhost:63280/docs> to view the swagger UI.

![Swagger UI](./media/module-04/swagger_ui.png)

This app comes with a few pre-created tenant and user ids that you can use to test with.

| Tenant Id | User Id  |
|-----------|----------|
| Contoso   | Mark     |
| Contoso   | Sandeep  |
| Contoso   | Theo     |
| Fabrikan  | Sajee    |
| Fabrikan  | Abhishek |
| Fabrikan  | David    |

We will demonstrate this doing manual testing using the Swagger UI with these operations below. To automate this, you'd take the URIs you see in Swagger and write REST API calls using a testing tool.

Create a new session with tenantId = `Contoso` and userId = `Mark`

![Create a new session](./media/module-04/post_create_session.png)

Click Execute.

Capture the value of the new sessionId

```json
{
  "id": "653cc488-e9d5-4af4-9175-9410e501acb9",
  "type": "session",
  "sessionId": "653cc488-e9d5-4af4-9175-9410e501acb9",
  "tenantId": "Contoso",
  "userId": "Mark",
  "tokensUsed": 0,
  "name": "Mark Brown",
  "messages": []
}
```

Next use the tenantId, userId, and the sessionId created above to say "Hello there!" to our agents.

![Create a new completion](./media/module-04/post_create_completion.png)

Fill in the values and click execute.

Here you can see the request from Swagger and the response from our agent.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1a568dff-43fe-4477-977b-9c21c8bf61f3",
    "type": "ai_response",
    "sessionId": "653cc488-e9d5-4af4-9175-9410e501acb9",
    "tenantId": "Contoso",
    "userId": "Mark",
    "timeStamp": "",
    "sender": "User",
    "senderRole": "User",
    "text": "Hello there!",
    "debugLogId": "a7203518-51d3-4df8-aa43-7c041b553776",
    "tokensUsed": 0,
    "rating": true,
    "completionPromptId": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "10c6daa8-714d-41d8-b564-99a6c8ffdb5d",
    "type": "ai_response",
    "sessionId": "653cc488-e9d5-4af4-9175-9410e501acb9",
    "tenantId": "Contoso",
    "userId": "Mark",
    "timeStamp": "",
    "sender": "Coordinator",
    "senderRole": "Assistant",
    "text": "Hi there! Welcome to our bank. How can I assist you today? Are you looking for help with general inquiries, opening a new account or loan, or managing transactions? Let me know!",
    "debugLogId": "a7203518-51d3-4df8-aa43-7c041b553776",
    "tokensUsed": 265,
    "rating": true,
    "completionPromptId": ""
  }
]
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Frontend is loading correctly, and testing on the UI works correctly.
- [ ] LangSmith is showing the traces of the project correctly.
- [ ] Swagger UI is working correctly, and you are able to test the API's there.
