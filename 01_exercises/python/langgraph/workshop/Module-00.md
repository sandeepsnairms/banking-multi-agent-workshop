> **Note**: This module prepares your environment for the complete workshop, including the advanced Module 6 covering Model Context Protocol (MCP) architectural patterns.

## Activity 1 Configure Workshop Environment

Complete the following tasks in order to prepare your environment for this workshop.

:warning: **Important:** These pre-requisites are a hard requirement for successful completion of this workshop. If you do not have all three you will not be able to successfully complete this workshop.

### Prerequisites

- Laptop or workstation with **administrator rights** You will need to install packages and apps on your machine. (Alternatively you can run this workshop virtually in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces))
- Azure subscription with **owner rights**
- Subscription access to Azure OpenAI service. Start here to [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If you have access, see below for ensuring enough quota to deploy.

   #### Checking Azure OpenAI quota limits

   For this sample to deploy successfully, there needs to be enough Azure OpenAI quota for the models used by this sample within your subscription. This sample deploys a new Azure OpenAI account with two models, **gpt-4.1-mini with 30K tokens** per minute and **text-3-large with 5k tokens** per minute. For more information on how to check your model quota and change it, see [Manage Azure OpenAI Service Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota)

   #### Azure Subscription Permission Requirements

   This solution deploys a [user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and defines then applies Azure Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI RBAC permissions to this as well as your own Service Principal Id. You will need the following Azure RBAC roles assigned to your identity in your Azure subscription or [Subscription Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) access which will give you both of the following.

   - [Manged Identity Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor)
   - [Cosmos DB Operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/databases#cosmos-db-operator)
   - [Cognitive Services OpenAI User](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#cognitive-services-openai-user)

### Get Started

You can choose from the following options to get started with the workshop.

#### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this sample app and workshop virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

:bulb: **Note:** It is recommended to extend the time-out period for Codespaces in your GitHub profile. During lunchtime your Codespace may sit idle which will force you to relaunch your Codespace and you may lose any changes. To extend the time-out go to your profile in GitHub, click on Settings, then Codespaces. You can extend up to 240 minutes (4 hours). Be sure to change this back after the workshop to avoid excessive compute charges to your GitHub Codespaces.

1. Open the template (this may take several minutes):

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/tree/WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer/python/devcontainer.json)

2. Open a terminal in VS Code.

#### Local Environment using VS Code Dev Containers

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) along with the [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_install-the-extension) extension.

2. Clone the repository and checkout the WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop/01_exercises
   git fetch --all
   git checkout WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph
   ```

3. Open the repository in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** when prompted.

4. Wait for the container to build and start. This is a one time operation and may take a few minutes.

5. Move on to the [Deployment](Module-00.md#deployment) section.

#### Local Environment without VS Code Dev Containers

> :warning: **NOTE**
> For the MCP parts of the workshop in module 5 to function properly, you must be running in a Linux environment. If you are on Windows, consider installing WSL, switching to dev containers or running in Codespaces.

1. To run the workshop locally on your machine, install the following:

   - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
   - [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Your Python IDE or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
   - To build and run the frontend component, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/installation#install-angular-cli)


   ⚠️ To complete the deployment from WSL into Azure you must first install PowerShell and Docker into WSL. You will also need to install the WSL extension into VS Code. You can then open a WSL session and type code . and follow the 

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop/01_exercises
   git checkout WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph
   ```

3. Move on to the [Deployment](Module-00.md#deployment) section.

## Activity 2: Deploy Azure Services

### Deployment

1. From the terminal, switch to the `WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph
   ```

1. Navigate to the correct folder:

   ```bash
   cd 01_exercises/python/langgraph/infra
   ```

1. Log in to Azure using AZD.

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

1. If using Codespaces, also log in to Azure CLI.

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

1. Provision the Azure services and deploy the application.

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

This step will take approximately 10-15 minutes. If you encounter an error during step, first rerun `azd up`. This tends to correct most errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter any errors during the deployment, rerun `azd up` to continue the deployment from where it left off. This will not create duplicate resources, and tends to resolve most issues.

1. When the resources are finally deployed, you will see a message in the terminal like below:

```bash
Deploying services (azd deploy)

  (✓) Done: Deploying service ChatServiceWebApi
  - Endpoint: https://ca-webapi-6xbkqp3ybtbuw.whitemoss-86b36485.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/

Do you want to add some dummy data for testing? (yes/no): y
```

1. Press `y` to load the data for the workshop.

1. Press `y` to deploy the front end for the workshop.

⚠️ You may run into errors trying to deploy the web app from WSL. If so, modify your DNS to use public DNS server.

```shell
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Activity 3: Workshop Structure and Overview Session

While the Azure Services are deploying we will have a presentation to cover on the structure for this workshop for today as well as provide an introduction and overview of multi-agent systems.

### Workshop Module Overview

This workshop consists of 6 progressive modules:

- **Module 0**: Prerequisites and Setup (this module)
- **Module 1**: Creating Your First Agent
- **Module 2**: Connecting Agents to Memory
- **Module 3**: Agent Specialization
- **Module 4**: Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Module 5**: Converting to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Module 6**: Lessons Learned, Agent Futures, Q&A

**Module 5** introduces advanced architectural patterns using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), showing how to convert your multi-agent system from native LangChain tools to a standardized, loosely-coupled architecture that enables better team collaboration and maintainability.

## Activity 4: Configure Environment Variables

When you deploy this solution it automatically injects endpoints and configuration values for the required resources into a `.env` file at root (python/langgraph) folder.

But you will still need to install dependencies to run the solution locally.

1. Navigate to the python/langgraph folder of the project.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Linux/Mac/WSL/Codespaces):

   ```shell
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the project.

   ```shell
   pip install -r src/app/requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: If getting `requirements.txt` file not found when using GitHub codespaces, please navigate to the `src/app` folder and run the command there `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Activity 5: Compile and Run

### Running the solution

1. Navigate to the python/langgraph folder of the project.
2. Start the fastapi server.

   ```shell
   uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 63280
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:63280/docs`. This has been pre-built with boilerplate code that will create chat sessions and store the chat history in Cosmos DB.

#### Run the Frontend on local machine

1. Open a **new terminal**, navigate to the `01_exercises/frontend` folder and run the following to start the application:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

1. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>.


#### Run the Frontend App on Codespaces

1. Open a **new terminal**, navigate to the `01_exercises/frontend` folder and run the following to start the application:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```

1. From the **Ports** tab:
   1. Right-click and select the **Port Visibility** option to set port **ChatAPI (63280)** as **Public**.
   1. For the port with the label **Frontend app**. Hover over the address and choose **Open in Browser** (second icon) to access the frontend application.

### Exploring your new app

Lets try a couple of things:

1. Try out the API by creating a chat session in the front end. This should return a response saying "Hello, I am not yet implemented".
1. Navigate to the Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal to view the containers. You should see an entry in the `Chat` container. If you selected "yes" to the option during `azd up`, there will also be some transactional data in the `OffersData`, `AccountsData`, and `Users` containers as well.
1. Take a look at the files in the `src/app/services` folder - these are the boilerplate code for interacting with the Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI services.
1. You will also see an empty file `src/app/banking_agents.py` as well as empty files in the `src/app/tools` and `src/app/prompts` folder. This is where you will build your multi-agent system!

Next, we will start building the agents that will be served by the API layer and interact with Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI using LangGraph!

### Deployment Validation

Use the steps below to validate that the solution was deployed successfully.

- [ ] All Azure resources are deployed successfully
- [ ] You can compile the solution in CodeSpaces or locally
- [ ] You can start the project and it runs without errors

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. Errors during azd deployment:

   - Service principal "not found" error.
      - Rerun `azd up`
   - If you are running on Windows with Powershell, you may get:
      - `"error executing step command 'deploy --all': getting target resource: resource not found: unable to find a resource tagged with 'azd-service-name: ChatServiceWebApi'"`
      - This is likely because you have used Az CLI before, and have an old default resource group name cached that is different from the one specified during `azd up`.
   - To resolve this:
      - Delete `.azure` in the root folder and `.azd` folders in your home directory (`C:\Users\<user name>`).
      - Start again, but first set resource group explicitly. Replace <environment name> in the below with the name you intend to set for your environment:
         - `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-<environment name>`
         - Then enter <environment name> when prompted:
         - `Enter a new environment name: <environment name>`
         - Run `azd auth login` again
         - Then run `azd up` again.

1. Azure OpenAI deployment issues:

   - Ensure your subscription has access to Azure OpenAI
   - Check regional availability

1. Python environment issues:

   - Ensure correct Python version
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

1. Your Codespace times out

   You need to restart your Codespace and backend and frontend for the app.

   Start the backend, go to the Terminal

   ```sh
   # Navigate to the python/langgraph folder
   cd 01_exercises/python/langgraph

   # start the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate

   #Restart the backend
   uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 63280
   ```

   Start the front end, open a **New Terminal**

   ```sh
   # Navigate to the frontend folder
   cd 01_exercises/frontend

   # start the frontend
   ng serve
   ```

   Be sure to check the ports for the frontend (4200) and backend (63280) are still set to Public. Click the second icon, a globe in the Ports tab to open the frontend web app.

## Success Criteria

To complete this Module successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that all services have been deployed successfully.
- Have an open IDE or CodeSpaces session with the source code and environment variables loaded.
- Be able to compile and run the application with no warnings or errors.

## Next Steps

Proceed to [Creating Your First Agent](./Module-01.md) to begin building your multi-agent banking system. The complete learning path will take you through:

1. **Modules 1-4**: Core multi-agent system development
2. **Module 5**: Advanced MCP architectural patterns
3. **Module 6**: Best practices, lessons learned, Q&A and wrap-up
