# Multi-Agent AI application using LangGraph

## Description

This is a sample that exposes turn-by-turn conversation with a multi-agent banking application using the Azure OpenAI gpt-4o model, via REST API delivered through FastAPI that stores chat history and message state in Azure Cosmos DB. The agents are implemented using LangGraph. Each agent is a state machine that can handle a few banking-related tasks. A simple CLI tool is provided that consumes the REST API and allows the user to interact with the agents. This sample also comes with an Angular Frontend that can be optionally deployed with this sample.

## CLI User Experience

### How it works

1. `banking_agents_api.py`: This is a FastAPI server that exposes a REST API to interact with the banking multi-agent program build using LangGraph. It will:
   - Save chat memory in Azure CosmosDB using the native LangGraph [checkpoint implementation for Azure Cosmos DB](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph-checkpoint-cosmosdb/).
   - Provide operations including `/tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/sessions` to create a sessionId (used as [thread_id](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/#threads) in langgraph) in UserData for each user.
   - Create user data in Cosmos DB with [hierarchical partitioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/hierarchical-partition-keys) so that multitenancy for users and sessions can be supported.
   - Return user prompt and agent responses in the last "turn" of the conversation to the client.
1. `banking_agents.py`: This defines the agents and tools in the graph with routing logic. It will:
   - Always route to coordinator agent first, which hands over the conversation to the appropriate sub-agent.
   - Each sub-agent either:
     - Routes to another agent.
     - Calls a tool (functionality). Tools are implemented in a single unified [MCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol) server that can be used by all agents - see  `/app/tools/mcp_server.py`. The server is started using `MultiServerMCPClient` (part of `langchain-mcp-adapters` package) in `banking_agents.py`. The MCP server could also be started and consumed separately by a different application, but in this sample it is started as part of the application.
       
1. `banking_agents_api_cli.py`: This is a simple CLI tool that consumes the FastAPI server endpoint. It will:
   - Creates a sessionId using `POST /tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/sessions` endpoint
   - Sends messages to the agent using `POST /tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}/completion` endpoint and prints the responses to the console
   - Deletes session using `DELETE /tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}` endpoint when user types "exit".
1. `azure_open_ai.py`: This is a utility class that defines Azure OpenAI credentials and initialises Azure OpenAI API client
1. `azure_cosmos_db.py`: This is a utility class that defines Azure Cosmos DB credentials, Database and Container name for storing conversation memory

## Getting Started

Complete the following tasks in order to prepare your environment for this sample.

### Prerequisites

- Laptop or workstation with **administrator rights** (Alternatively you can run this sample virtually in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces))
- Azure subscription with **owner rights**
- Subscription access to Azure OpenAI service. Start here to [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If you have access, see below for ensuring enough quota to deploy.

  #### Checking Azure OpenAI quota limits

  For this sample to deploy successfully, there needs to be enough Azure OpenAI quota for the models used by this sample within your subscription. This sample deploys a new Azure OpenAI account with two models, **gpt-4o with 30K tokens** per minute and **text-3-embedding-small with 5k tokens** per minute. For more information on how to check your model quota and change it, see [Manage Azure OpenAI Service Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota)

  #### Azure Subscription Permission Requirements

  This solution deploys a [user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and defines then applies Azure Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI RBAC permissions to this as well as your own Service Principal Id. You will need the following Azure RBAC roles assigned to your identity in your Azure subscription or [Subscription Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) access which will give you both of the following.

  - [Manged Identity Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor)
  - [Cosmos DB Operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/databases#cosmos-db-operator)
  - [Cognitive Services OpenAI User](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#cognitive-services-openai-user)

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this sample app using GitHub Codespaces (requires a GitHub account). The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the template (this may take several minutes):

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop?branch=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fpython%2Fdevcontainer.json)

2. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

#### Local Environment using VS Code Dev Containers

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) along with the [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_install-the-extension) extension.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop
   ```

3. Open the repository in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** when prompted. When asked to **Select a devcontainer.json file**, select the **Python Development Container**.

4. Wait for the container to build and start. This is a one time operation and may take a few minutes.

5. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

#### Local Environment without VS Code Dev Containers

1. To run the workshop locally on your machine, install the following:

   - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   - [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/installation#install-angular-cli)
   - [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Your Python IDE or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop
   ```

3. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

### Deployment

1. Navigate to the correct folder:

   ```bash
   cd python/infra
   ```

1. Log in to Azure using AZD. Follow the prompts to complete authentication.

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

1. Provision the Azure services and deploy the application.

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

This step will take approximately 10-15 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter any errors during the deployment, rerun `azd up` to continue the deployment from where it left off. This will not create duplicate resources, and tends to resolve most issues.

1. When the resources are finally deployed, you will see a message in the terminal like below:

```bash
Deploying services (azd deploy)

  (✓) Done: Deploying service ChatServiceWebApi
  - Endpoint: https://ca-webapi-6xbkqp3ybtbuw.whitemoss-86b36485.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/

Do you want to add some dummy data for testing? (yes/no): y
```

1. Press `y` to load the data for the workshop.

1. After the data is loaded, you will see a message in the terminal like below:

```bash
PUT offerdata Request Successful: True
PUT offerdata Request Successful: True
PUT offerdata Request Successful: True

Do you want to deploy the frontend app? (yes/no): 
```

1. Press `y` to deploy the frontend application.

### Setting up local debugging

When you deploy this solution it automatically injects endpoints and configuration values for the required resources into a `.env` file at root (python) folder.

But you will still need to install dependencies to run the solution locally.

1. Navigate to the python folder of the project.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Linux/Mac):

   ```shell
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```shell
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the project.

   ```shell
   pip install -r ../src/app/requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the solution

1. Navigate to the python folder of the project.
2. Start the fastapi server.

   ```shell
   uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

The API will be available at <http://localhost:8000/docs>. This has been pre-built with boilerplate code that will create chat sessions and store the chat history in Cosmos DB.

#### Run the Frontend App locally

1. Update the `apiUrl` values in `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` file with the API endpoint <http://localhost:8000/>
1. Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run the following to start the application:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

1. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8000/>.

#### Run the Frontend App on Codespaces

1. Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run the following to start the application:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

1. From the **Ports** tab:
   1. Right-click and select the **Port Visibility** option to set port **ChatAPI (8000)** as **Public**.
   1. For the port with the label **Frontend app**. Hover over the address and choose **Open in Browser** (second icon) to access the frontend application.

### Start a Conversation

1. Open the frontend app.
1. Start a new conversation.
1. Send the sequence of user prompts below to see the agents in action:

    ```text
    Who can help me here?
    Transfer $50 to my friend. (When prompted, give it an account number ranging from Acc001 to Acc009 and any email address)
    Looking for a Savings account with high interest rate.
    File a complaint about theft from my account.
    How much did I spend on groceries? (If prompted, say over the last 6 months)
    Provide me a statement of my account. (If prompted, give it an account number ranging from Acc001 to Acc009)
   ```

### Stop the Application

- In the frontend terminal, press **Ctrl + C** to stop the application.
- In your IDE press **Shift + F5** or stop the debugger.
- If you are in CodeSpaces, go to each terminal and press **Ctrl + C**.
