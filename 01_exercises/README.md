# Multi Agent Workshop

Welcome to our multi-agent samples repository showcasing a retail banking scenario using 

- Semantic Kernel Agents in C#
- LangGraph in Python

This folder contains the starter files for the exercises. Begin with the minimal scaffolding code and follow the step-by-step instructions to complete each exercise.

If you prefer to skip the exercises and [go straight to the final code](../02_completed) and artifacts for running the demo.


## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.

## Guidance

### Region Availability

This template uses gpt-4o and text-embedding-3-large models which may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) and select a region during deployment accordingly.
