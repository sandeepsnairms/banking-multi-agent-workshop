# Multi Agent Workshop using LangGraph in Python

> [!NOTE]
> This application will only work in a Linux environment.

This module contains the completed files for the exercises. If you prefer to begin with the minimal scaffolding code and follow the step-by-step instructions to complete each exercise go to [exercises](../../01_exercises/README.md).

To run the multi-agent application using Azure Cosmos DB and LangGraph in Python, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Laptop or workstation with **administrator rights** (Alternatively you can run this sample virtually in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces))
- Azure subscription with **owner rights**
- Subscription access to Azure OpenAI service. Start here to [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If you have access, see below for ensuring enough quota to deploy.

  #### Checking Azure OpenAI quota limits

  For this sample to deploy successfully, there needs to be enough Azure OpenAI quota for the models used by this sample within your subscription. This sample deploys a new Azure OpenAI account with two models, **gpt-4o with 30K tokens** per minute and **text-3-embedding-small with 5k tokens** per minute. For more information on how to check your model quota and change it, see [Manage Azure OpenAI Service Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota)

  #### Azure Subscription Permission Requirements

  This solution deploys a [user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and defines then applies Azure Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI RBAC permissions to this as well as your own Service Principal Id. You will need the following Azure RBAC roles assigned to your identity in your Azure subscription or [Subscription Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) access which will give you both of the following.

  - [Manged Identity Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor)
  - [Cosmos DB Operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/databases#cosmos-db-operator)
  - [Cognitive Services OpenAI User](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#cognitive-services-openai-user)

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this sample app using GitHub Codespaces (requires a GitHub account). The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the template (this may take several minutes):

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/tree/WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer/python/devcontainer.json)

2. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

#### Local Environment using VS Code Dev Containers

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) along with the [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_install-the-extension) extension.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop/02_completed
   git checkout WorkShop_v2_PythonLangGraph
   ```

3. Open the repository in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** when prompted.

4. Wait for the container to build and start. This is a one time operation and may take a few minutes.

5. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

#### Local Environment without VS Code Dev Containers

1. To run the workshop locally on your machine, install the following:

   - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   - [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/installation#install-angular-cli)
   - [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Your Python IDE or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/
   cd banking-multi-agent-workshop/02_completed
   git checkout HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph
   ```

3. Move on to the [Deployment](readme.md#deployment) section.

### Deployment

1. Navigate to the `infra` folder:

   ```bash
   cd infra
   ```

2. Log in to Azure using AZD. Follow the prompts to complete authentication:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

3. Provision the Azure services and deploy the application:

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   This step will take approximately 10-15 minutes and will:
   - Create all required Azure resources (Cosmos DB, Azure OpenAI, Container Apps, etc.)
   - Deploy both the Banking API and MCP Server as Container Apps
   - Configure authentication and networking between services
   - Set up environment variables automatically

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you encounter any errors during the deployment, rerun `azd up` to continue the deployment from where it left off. This will not create duplicate resources.

4. When the deployment completes successfully, you will see endpoint URLs for both services:

   ```bash
   SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in X minutes.
   
   Banking API: https://ca-webapi-xxxxx.azurecontainerapps.io/
   MCP Server: https://ca-mcpserver-xxxxx.azurecontainerapps.io/
   ```

5. The deployment will automatically:
   - Load sample banking data (accounts, transactions, offers)
   - Configure MCP client-server communication
   - Set up authentication tokens
   - Update environment variables

### Setting up local development

When you deploy this solution, it automatically configures `.env` files with the required Azure endpoints and authentication tokens for both the main application and MCP server.

To run the solution locally after deployment:

#### Terminal 1 - Start the MCP Server:

Open new terminal, navigate to the `mcpserver/python` folder, then run:

Windows:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:PYTHONPATH="src"; python src/mcp_http_server.py
```

Linux/Mac:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  
PYTHONPATH=src python src/mcp_http_server.py
```

#### Terminal 2 - Start the Banking API:

Open a new terminal, navigate to `02_completed/python/langgraph` folder, then run:


Windows:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r src/app/requirements.txt
uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 63280
```

Linux/Mac:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r src/app/requirements.txt
uvicorn src.app.banking_agents_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 63280
```

#### Terminal 3 - Start the Frontend (optional):

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder, then run

```bash
npm install
npm ng serve
```
